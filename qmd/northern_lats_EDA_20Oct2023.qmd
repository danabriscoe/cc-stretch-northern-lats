### Fig 1 \| Cohort 1 & SSTa 

<span style="font-size:14pt">

Figure 1 shows the average monthly SST anomalies (SSTa) from July - Sept, 2023. The STRETCH turtles deployed in July 2023 (n=`r length(unique(daily_df$id))`) are referred to as 'Cohort 1'. The tracks from 11 July - 30 Sept 2023 are shown in colors corresponding to the Wildlife Computers [map](https://my.wildlifecomputers.com/data/map/?id=646c14fae9b3514a9430a544). <br>

The 1.5°C SSTa contour is shown in black. The Thermal Corridor study area is outlined in gray. SSTa source: [NOAA Coral Reef Watch, Monthly 5km](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_sst.php).

<span style="font-size:14pt">

Figure 2 shows the long-term average of SST for the month of September (1997-2023) with the locations of the 18°C isotherm. 

For each turtle located between 165°W-140°W longitude during the month of September, their maximum and average lat and long locations are shown as colored circles. 

The <span style="color:#6D4C94"> **historic tracks (1997-2012, n=`r nrow(mean_lats_historic)`)** </span> are shown as the <span style="color:#6D4C9"> **purple circles** </span> (dark purple = max, light purple = average monthly location).

The 18°C isotherm is a reference for the seasonal location of the TZCF. 
The gray line represents the average September TZCF location from 1997-2012. The pink line represents the average September TZCF location from 2005-2006, and the white line represents the TZCF location for September 2023.

Figure 3 compares the average latitudes experienced by 2023's Cohort 1 turtles (green line) and turtles from the historic data set ('Historic' 1997-2012, purple line). Latitudes were spatially averaged eastern North Pacific region, between 165°W to 140°W longitude. The gray bands represent ± 2 standard deviations.

### SFig 5 \| Sept Lats: Mean vs Median

Summary statistics for the historic data set show there is negatively skewed to the distribution of September latitudes. <br> **The mean of September latitudes: `r hist_all_stats$value[1]`** <br> **The median of September latitudes: `r hist_all_stats$value[2]`**
