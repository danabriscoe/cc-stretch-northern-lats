### Fig 1 \| Cohort 1 & SSTa 

<span style="font-size:14pt">

Figure 1 shows the average monthly SST anomalies (SSTa) from July - Sept, 2023. The STRETCH turtles deployed in July 2023 (n=`r length(unique(daily_df$id))`) are referred to as 'Cohort 1'. The tracks from 11 July - 30 Sept 2023 are shown in the same color palette that corresponds to the Wildlife Computers [map](https://my.wildlifecomputers.com/data/map/?id=646c14fae9b3514a9430a544). <br>

The 1.5°C SSTa contour is shown in black. The Thermal Corridor study area is outlined in gray. <br>

Figure 2 shows the long-term average of SST for the month of September (1997-2023) with the locations of the 18°C isotherm. 

For each turtle located between 165°W-140°W longitude during the month of September, their maximum and average lat and long locations are shown as colored circles. 

The <span style="color:#6D4C94"> **historic tracks (1997-2012, n=`r mean_lats_historic$id |> n_distinct()`)** </span> are shown as the <span style="color:#6D4C9"> **purple circles** </span>.

### Fig 3 \| Turtles & Avg Lats

Figure 3 compares the average latitudes experienced by 2023's Cohort 1 turtles (green line) and turtles from the historic data set ('Historic' 1997-2012, purple line). Latitudes were spatially averaged eastern North Pacific region, between 165°W to 140°W longitude. The gray bands represent ± 2 standard deviations.

Cohort 1 (2023, n=25) turtles are shown in green.

### Fig 5 \| GAM Results 

The following GAMs explore evidence of latitudinal shifts in SST over time.

**Min, Mean, Max of the 18°C SST isotherm between (165W-140W longitude ~ Year (1997-2023)**

Preliminary results of these 3 models (min, mean, max) showed similar results. 
<br>

To explore this in further detail, these summary statistics were plotted for visual review of the variability between min, mean, and max isotherm latitudes per year. 

The figures below are exploratory and were used to confirm the reason for similarity between the min, mean, max GAM results.

Based on the above figures, the average latitude of the March and Sept 18°C SST isotherm (1997-2023) were run. Models were run using leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) and kfolds (k=5) cross validation. The kfolds models with the lowest RMSE results are shown below:

### SFig 3 \| Seasonal TZCF 

SFigure 3 shows the average location of the 18°C SST isotherm during March (A) and September (B), 1997-2023

For each figure, the darker line represents the average isotherm location location between 1997-2022). The light pink line represents the 2005-2006 location, and the white line represents the 2023 isotherm location.

### SFig 4 \| Seasonal TZCF by Year 

SFigure 4 shows the seasonal position of the 18°C SST isotherm between 165°W and 140°W longitude. 

For each year between 1997-2023 (which encompasses both the historic tags and current, 'Cohort 1'), the annual isotherm trend is plotted as a gray line. The years 2005, 2015, 2019 (light colors) and 2023 (dark red) are highlighted as they were anomalously warm years.

### SFig 5 \| Sept Lats: Mean vs Median

Summary statistics for the Historic turtle tracks between 165°W and 140°W longitude (n=`r mean_lats_historic$id |> n_distinct()`) show there is a negative skew to the distribution of September latitudes. <br> **The mean of September latitudes: `r hist_all_stats$value[1]`** <br> **The median of September latitudes: `r hist_all_stats$value[2]`**
